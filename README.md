Hi, I’m Abhilash. I currently work as a Graduate Research Assistant at South Dakota School of Mines and Technology. I will graduate with a Ph.D degree in Biological Engineering by May 2022. During my graduate studies, I have honed my skills in data analysis and visualization using R and Python. I am also studying Machine learning to identify patterns in the data. 
I’m looking to collaborate data analysis and machine learning.
